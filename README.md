## Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository showcases various examples of SQL I have written. Take a look around, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Enjoy exploring!

### I have extensive experience in the medical field, particularly in laboratory medicine and transfusion medicine. While I am new to SQL, my background has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I am eager to apply these skills in new industries and continuously expand my knowledge in SQL and data management.
